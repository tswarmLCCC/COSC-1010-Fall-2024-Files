Predict and Run - First, have a look at the code.  Without doing anything else, study the code and think about what might happen.  After you have done this, run the code.  What went as expected?  What did not go as expected?

Investigate -This optional exercise is a bit like the previous one, but poses a few questions about the structure of the code itself.

Modify - In this optional exercise, you will be given some working code and asked to modify it slightly.
